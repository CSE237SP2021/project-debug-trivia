# Debug: Trivia for Insect Lovers

Mia Collymore Abbas, Nina Redpath, and Sarah Willis

This project is a multiple-choice trivia game centered around bugs that increases with difficulty with each new level and corresponding new bug!

For this iteration we did the following: 
	set up our repo and kanban board\n
	mapped out the general structure of our code (in terms of classes, interfaces etc)
	\n created a level one class and player class that hold information 
	\n created the basic play loop so that one level can be played ** note that the trivia is placeholder questions, not real trivia yet. 
	\n created a score system that updates when a question is correct. 
	
Usage: 
	please download the repository and navigate to it in your terminal 
	run Javac Play.java
	run java Play. 
	have fun!! 
	
** Note that the responses to the trivia questions should be one capital letter, ex: "A"


For the next iteration we will do the following: 
	add the rest of the levels 
	input real trivia 
	make the instructions more user - friendly. 
	make the level increment when the current level is finished 
	add unit testing
